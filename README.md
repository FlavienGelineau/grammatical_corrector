# grammatical_corrector
A grammatical correcteur in Java

    ALREADY DONE :
- Stocking of a dictionnary
- Extracting fonction of the dictionnary, to get them into an array

    TO DO :
- Distance function between two words of the same length
- Testing of the first distance function
- Distance function between two words of a different length (with different costs)
- Testing the second distance function
- Test, develop and implement the different costs of the second distance function
- First Global Programm taking one word as an imput and returning the answer 
- Function that gave the different modifications (1,2,replacement, keyboard transfer, poping of a letter) that can be done on a word, in an array
- Test the modification function
- Function that from an array of words, give an array of words of those found in the dictionnay (path is an argument)
- Test the founding function
- Function that returns the most probable word (with costs and occurences) of a list
- Test the Most Probable Word funtion
- Searching on different references and Stocking the recurents of each different words of a dictionnary, to get the most probable answer
- Check the results of the searching function

-Get ideas
-Sort it 
-List typical errors to correct
-
-Get a dictionnary
-Process the data
-Create a distance class ( a best matching-unit function )
-take numbers into account


Bad Ideas ( Troll )
-Create a cost function correlated to the distance class

When the project will be well built
-Learning
